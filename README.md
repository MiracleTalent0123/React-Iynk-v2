# lynk-v2

## Project Outline
- You will be working on one page at a time.
- While working on this page you will probably have to create several components and then use these components in your page.
- The components for each page will be specified at the start of each mini-sprint page's development, as well as the props that each component should take.

## The Development Process
1. You will do all your work on a dedicated GitHub branch, which will be given to you.
2. When you have completed the feature you will create a pull request from your branch into our release branch.
3. I will review your code and test the feature. At this point I may request changes via Github, which you will then make.
4. Once I am happy with the code and tested everything works, the pull request will be approved and merged into the release branch. We will then release payment to you.
5. You will be assigned another feature and given another GitHub branch and this process will be repeated.

## Coding Standards

- All react files should be written in typescript and types should be specified where you think is appropriate.
- As much as possible styling should be done in CSS using bootstrap, although sometimes it is okay to do inline styling (e.g. if you are setting the width of an element)
- We would also like you to use a CSS variable for the primary color ("#FFB3B3") and the primary font ("Poppins")
- We use ESLint for code formatting and you should ensure your code complies with all our ESLint rules.
- Code should follow coding best practices and be as reusable as possible.
